== Description ==

First versions of **Absolute Comments** implemented several features that are now, out of the box, part of WordPress.

**Absolute Comments** now simply adds a "Reply" link into comment notification emails, prefills the comment reply with the commenter's name, and adds a few cute icons.

There's no option or settings: just activate and forget it's even a plugin.
